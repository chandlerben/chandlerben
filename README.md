I am a Research Scientist turned Software Developer with a passion for building high quality scalable products. I have a proven track record of shipping products on time, and within spec. I work with Javascript, React, Python, SQL, among others, and I'm quick to pick up new languages and frameworks.  Feel free to explore the projects I have used to learn Web Development and see what I am exploring now!
